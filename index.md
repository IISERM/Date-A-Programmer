## Question 4) Secret Love Messages [40 Marks]

Your parents check your phone very frequently. They don't know you are dating someone. So, you have come up with a way to encrypt and decrypt the messages you send to your loved one. Here's the proposed scheme that you have to implement-

Write a function `encrypt(message, key)` that takes a message and a key, which is an integer. It uses this key as a seed and uses a randomizing function in the language of your choice to shuffle the characters in the message. You have to shuffle the original string based on the key, using a shuffling function. The function returns the encrypted message.

Write a function `decrypt(encrypted_message, key)` that takes the encrypted message and the same key and decrypts the message and returns the decrypted message.
