## Question 2) Love Calculator [30 Marks]

You are working as a Love Guru/Astrologer (and a part time data analyst). Your clients come and ask you their compatibility with some prospective partners.

You bunked your classes at the Indian Institute of Astrological Science, not that attending them would have made a difference. But you did a data analysis course at Coursera and know how to convert the characters into Binary.

So, you have come up with the following ~~scam~~ scheme. You take both their names and convert it to binary. Then, you predict their compatibility by comparing the percentage similarity between the 2 binaries.


(b) You later coded this calculator and deployed it on a website. A multi-national company loved your ideas and paid you $10 million to acquire the model. Now, the company plans to create a simple love-letter based on your model's compatibility score.

You now have a job in the same company and you need to build this model which takes the compatibility score and accordingly designs a love letter with loving emojis, quotes, etc. (Remember more the compatibility score, more romantic the letter it would be.)

### Input

`Name of partner A`, `Name of partner B`

### Output

The percentage of love between them. And the love letter.

## Question 3) Draw a heart [40 Marks]

Draw a heart using just the character `*`. Take an input `n` from the user, which is a measure of the size of the heart, say, the number of rows. You are free to decide how you do it, whether you draw a filled one, or a hollow one. The following is an example-

```
For n = 8

  *   *   *   *   
*       *       * 
*               *

```

## Question 4) Secret Love Messages [40 Marks]

Your parents check your phone very frequently. They don't know you are dating someone. So, you have come up with a way to encrypt and decrypt the messages you send to your loved one. Here's the proposed scheme that you have to implement-

Write a function `encrypt(message, key)` that takes a message and a key, which is an integer. It uses this key as a seed and uses a randomizing function in the language of your choice to shuffle the characters in the message. You have to shuffle the original string based on the key, using a shuffling function. The function returns the encrypted message.

Write a function `decrypt(encrypted_message, key)` that takes the encrypted message and the same key and decrypts the message and returns the decrypted message.
